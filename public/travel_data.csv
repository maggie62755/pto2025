3,在水星看日出,Mercury Sunrise Expedition: Closest to the Sun!,Mercury,"Mercury spins slowly on its axis and completes one rotation every 59 Earth days. But when Mercury is moving fastest in its elliptical orbit around the Sun (and it is closest to the Sun), each rotation is not accompanied by sunrise and sunset like it is on most other planets. The morning Sun appears to rise briefly, set, and rise again from some parts of the planet's surface. The same thing happens in reverse at sunset for other parts of the surface. One Mercury solar day (one full day-night cycle) equals 176 Earth days – just over two years on Mercury.","https://science.nasa.gov/mercury/facts/, https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11350",Mercury/PIA11350.jpg

The broad ridges and valleys making up Maxwell and Fortuna suggest that the topography resulted from compression.",,Venus/Maxwell.jpeg
12,造訪金星的峽谷,Visiting Cleopatra Crater,Venus,"Cleopatra is a double-ring impact basin about 100 kilometers (62 miles) in diameter and 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) deep. A steep-walled, winding channel a few kilometers wide breaks through the rough terrain surrounding the crater rim. A large amount of lava originating in Cleopatra flowed through this channel and filled valleys in Fortuna Tessera. Cleopatra is superimposed on the structures of Maxwell Montes and appears to be undeformed, indicating that Cleopatra is relatively young.",https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/pia00149-venus-maxwell-montes-and-cleopatra-crater,Venus/Maxwell.jpeg

17,成為阿姆斯壯,Become Armstrong: Walk on the Moon to Relive the Experience of Armstrong's Lunar Landing!,Earth/Moon,"Armstrong is probably best known as the commander of NASA’s Apollo 11 mission to the moon, during which he became the first person to set foot on the moon on July 20, 1969. Armstrong amassed a total of eight days and 14 hours in space during two space flights, including two hours and 14 minutes walking on the moon. In March 1966, he commanded the Gemini 8 orbital space flight with David Scott as pilot that accomplished the first successful docking of two vehicles in orbit. That was followed by the famed Apollo 11 lunar landing mission in July 1969.",https://www.nasa.gov/people/neil-a-armstrong/,Earth/Armstrong.webp

23,月震體驗,Experience Moonquakes,Earth/Moon,"Astronauts left several Passive Seismic Experiments (PSE) on the lunar surface during the Apollo missions. The seismometers on these devices detected moonquakes, impacts from meteorites, and impacts of man-made origin (also known as artificial impacts). Numerous moonquakes occur during sunset and sunrise when the lunar surface temperature changes rapidly on either side of the day/night terminator line. Many of those moonquakes even occur on mapped fault lines.",,space.jpeg

Asaph Hall discovered both the Red Planet's moons in 1877. Stickney crater is about 6-miles (9.7 kilometers) wide, and takes up about half the moon's surface. NASA Mars Global Surveyor took images of the crater, and it appears to be filled with fine dust, with evidence of boulders sliding down its sloped surface.",https://science.nasa.gov/mars/moons/phobos/,Mars/phobos.png

31,火星地形探索:造訪太陽系中的最高峰,Conquer Olympus Mons: Explore the Tallest Volcano in the Solar System,Mars,"Olympus Mons is the largest known volcano in the Solar System. It is 27 kilometers high, over 600 kilometers at the base, and is surrounded by a well-defined scarp that is up to 6 km high. Lava flows drape over the scarp in places. Much of the plains surrounding the volcano are covered by the ridged and grooved 'aureole' of Olympus Mons. The origin of the aureole is controversial, but may be related to gravity sliding off of the flanks of an ancestral volcano. The summit caldera (central depression) is almost 3 km deep and 25 km across. It probably formed from recurrent collapse following drainage of magma resulting from flank eruptions.",https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/pia00300-olympus-mons,Mars/Olympus_Mons.jpg

34,在火星上搜集垃圾，為環保更盡一份力,Removing Artificial Objects to Cleanse Mars,Mars,"During the past era of the space race, numerous Mars probes were launched in the pursuit of Mars exploration. Among them, many faced failures, whether due to crashes or retirement. However, these spacecraft were not retrieved, and they now remain on Mars, becoming artificial objects on Mars. Today, we have the opportunity to walk in the footsteps of history, while also taking the initiative to collect and remove them.
